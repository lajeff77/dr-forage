## Local Setup 

### Choose an IDE for development
My recommendations for code editors for development in Python are PyCharm or VSCode. I use PyCharm. If you don't have one of these IDEs, I highly recommend downloading them.

Pycharm has a free community version available for download here for Windows, Mac, and Linux: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download

VSCode is completely free and available for download here for Windosws, Mac, and Linux: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

### Ensure you have Python 3 installed
I am using version `3.9.4` of Python. As long as you have that version or higher, you don't need to do any setup.

Here's instructions for setting up Python on Windows or Mac: https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-install-python

### Clone the Repository
See the Github docs for further instruction: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

### Install the Requirements
As with any Python project, you want to insure you install the dependencies through the requirements.txt file.
In your terminal ensure you have navigated to the project folder run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you want to know more about the requirements file check out this resource: https://learnpython.com/blog/python-requirements-file/

### Setup Complete!
You should be able to run this game from the `main.py` file on your system now.
